      <h4>About me.</h4>
      <p>
        I've beeen caoching basketball for about five years. At the start of
        2022 I wanted to start learning Software Developing and began at
        Thinkful. Since then I have worked on the skills it takes to become a
        Software Developer and have enjoyed every minute of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing I really enjoy is working with others and learning from them
        and how they work problems and design websites. So I am eager and willing to work with others.
      </p>
      <p>
         I love sports! Especially the University of Tennessee football and
        basketball! Feel free to contact me for any needs you might have!
      </p>
